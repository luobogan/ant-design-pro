     * Case 2: When this action type is an insert operation and the other action type is a
     *         non-insert operation, you need to retain the length of this action insert
     * Case 3: When this action is a delete operation, there are two scenarios:
     *      1) When other is a delete operation, since it is a delete operation, this has
     *         already been deleted, so the target does not need to be in delete, and it can
     *         be continued directly
     *      2) When other is the retain operation, although this action delete occurs first,
     *         the delete priority is higher, so the delete operation is retained, and the origin
     *         delete has been applied, so it is directly continued
     * Case 4: other is the delete operation, this is the retain operation, and the target delete operation
     *         is kept
     * Case 5: When both other and this are retain operations
     *      1) If the other body attribute does not exist, directly retain length
     *      2) If the other body property exists, then execute the TransformBody logic to override it
